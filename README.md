# Unity3D-Voxel-Engine
A voxel engine for Unity3D, Created May 2017. Contains mesh optimization, LOD, Chunking and more.


This is an old project and you'll probably have a tought time getting the code to work without any of the assets but hopefully you can figure it out :)

Here is a demo of the project on youtube.
